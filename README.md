# Premier League Strikers Data: 2025/2026 Season Analysis

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository serves as the central data hub for a statistical scouting and comparison project focusing on top strikers (center-forwards) expected to feature in the Premier League for the 2025/2026 season.

The project uses detailed, per-90-minute metrics from the preceding season to provide a multi-faceted view of player performance beyond simple goals and assists. The data allows for sophisticated analysis in areas such as:

* **Goal Efficiency:** Comparing Goals per 90 against Expected Goals (xG per 90) to measure finishing quality.
* **Off-Ball Contribution:** Analyzing defensive duels, interceptions, and pressuring success.
* **Playmaking:** Evaluating progressive passes, key passes, and expected assists (xA).
* **Presence:** Assessing touches in the box and aerial duel dominance.

## 📁 Data File

The full, original data is contained in a single, multi-sheet Excel workbook.

* **File Name:** `PREM St (1).xlsx`
* **Format:** `.xlsx` (Microsoft Excel Workbook)

Each sheet in the workbook isolates a specific statistical metric, allowing users to analyze rank order and raw data for that single category.

## 📝 Usage & Context

### Non-EPL Players

Please note that this dataset includes several highly-regarded strikers who did not play in the Premier League the entire previous season (e.g., V. Gyökeres, H. Ekitiké). While their statistics are vital for a full comparison, their metrics should be viewed with context, as league quality and tactical setup may influence their per-90 performance rates.

### Data Privacy

All data presented is publicly sourced and anonymized to focus purely on comparative player performance metrics.
